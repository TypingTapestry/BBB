## Problem-Solution Fit

The `target market` for **BBB** are individuals who are struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health issues. Family members and loved ones of individuals who are at risk of suicide are also a TM, as they would be the primary and secondary guarantors who would receive the encrypted messages.

The `problem` the platform addresses is the lack of communication and support for individuals who are struggling with suicidal thoughts. Many people who are at risk of suicide may not have the support or resources they need to reach out for help, and **BBB** provides a way for them to express their feelings and thoughts in safe and secure channels.

**BBB** provides a `solution` by allowing users to log in and write lengthy messages to loved ones, which are encrypted and can only be accessed by designated primary and secondary guarantors in the event of their passing. This provides a way for individuals who are at risk of suicide to express their feelings and thoughts in a safe space, while providing a way for loved ones to be alerted to their struggles so support may be provided.

**BBB** offers a `unique value proposition` by providing a secure and private way for individuals who are struggling with suicidal thoughts to communicate with loved ones and to be sure that their thoughts will be shared in the event of their passing. It also allows loved ones to be aware of the individual's struggles and to provide support, while helping to ensure that the individual's last words and wishes are not lost or forgotten.

**BBB** could theoretically be `monetized` by offering a subscription-based model where users pay a monthly or annual fee to access the app's features. Additionally, considerations can be made for paid add-ons like advanced security options, additional storage for messages, and other premium features. I'd much rather reach out to and partner with organizations and groups that focus on mental health and suicide prevention (Talkspace and BetterHelp, among others) to promote the platform to those in need.

**BBB**'s main avenues of `distribution` include Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store, alongside an official browser-based web application.
